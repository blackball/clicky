# clicky

Simple text editor (hopefully at some point) for Linux using xlib and xft.

# Building

Included in this project is a makefile for Linux when using g++.

To build the whole project and run clicky after the build, just run `make` or `make -s` for suppressed output.
If you just want to rebuild the executable without running it, run `make build`.
